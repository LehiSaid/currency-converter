# 💱 Currency Converter

A simple and responsive **currency converter web application** built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

This project allows users to convert values from **Brazilian Real (BRL)** to other currencies such as **US Dollar (USD)** and **Euro (EUR)** using predefined exchange rates. The interface was designed with a clean layout and intuitive user experience.

* Mobile-friendly width (375px)

The design focuses on clarity, simplicity, and usability.
